These factors influence eligibility for specialized loan programs and repayment schedules, tailoring the system's recommendations based on the student's educational path.\n",
        "\n",
        "Equally important is collecting financial information such as the student's expected family contribution (EFC), current income, outstanding loans, credit score, and savings, as this data helps assess their ability to repay loans without taking on excessive debt. Loan preferences, including the desired loan amount, repayment term, interest rate type, and flexibility in repayment, should also be considered to match the student's needs. Lastly, career goals and expected starting salary are essential to determine which loan options are most feasible based on the student’s future earning potential and eligibility for career-based loan forgiveness programs. Collecting all these data points ensures that the recommendation system can provide personalized, relevant, and affordable loan options.\n",

        "**2. Based on the data you chose to use in this recommendation system, would your model be using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or context-based filtering? Justify why the data you selected would be suitable for your choice of filtering method.**\n",
        "\n",
        "The recommendation system for student loan options would primarily use content-based filtering, which suggests loan options based on the characteristics of both the student and the loans themselves. Content-based filtering is ideal for this recommendation system because it focuses on matching the student’s unique profile to the features of different loan options. Unlike collaborative filtering, which relies on data from other users, content-based filtering uses the student's individual characteristics and financial needs to suggest the most suitable loans. By leveraging detailed attributes like demographics, academic background, and financial situation, the system can tailor recommendations without needing input from other students, ensuring that the suggestions are highly relevant and personalized.\n",

        "**3. Describe two real-world challenges that you would take into consideration while building a recommendation system for student loans. Explain why these challenges would be of concern for a student loan recommendation system.**\n",
        "\n",
        "When building a recommendation system for student loans, there are several significant challenges that can impact its effectiveness and fairness. Two major concerns are data privacy and security, as well as ensuring fairness and reducing bias in loan recommendations. The first challenge involves the collection of sensitive personal information, such as financial details (income, credit score), academic records (school, field of study), and demographic data (age, citizenship status). Mishandling or breaching this data can lead to severe consequences like identity theft, financial fraud, or legal violations. If students do not trust the system to safeguard their personal data, they may be reluctant to share the information necessary for accurate loan recommendations, undermining the system's effectiveness. \n",
        "\n",
        "The second challenge is ensuring fairness and reducing bias in the recommendation system. If the model or the data used to train it contains biases, certain groups of students—such as those from lower-income or minority backgrounds—could be unfairly disadvantaged. For example, if credit score is heavily weighted, students with limited financial history may be excluded from loan opportunities they are otherwise eligible for. This could perpetuate financial inequality by offering higher-interest loans to disadvantaged students or by denying them access to affordable options altogether. \n"
